The PacSAFE project is a response to demand from Pacific Island Countries for tools to better understand disaster impacts. The PacSAFE software tool is designed and developed for national disaster management offices and related agencies involved in planning for, preparing for and responding to natural disasters. The PacSAFE software tool was initially developed by the Pacific Community (SPC) for urban planners to interact with hazard and asset data, such as the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) asset database. The PacSAFE project, funded by the Government of Australia, with technical support from Geoscience Australia, aims to provide a tool that will enhance the ability of disaster managers to prepare for and respond to disasters, and to reduce the impacts of disasters on the local population and infrastructure.
